# HMOLS (Holey Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares)

This is my work on generalizing a construction by Stinson and Dinitz in section 4 of [MOLS With Holes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X83900559). Their construction uses a boolean Hadamard matrix of order 8 to obtain up to 6-HMOLS of order _q_, where _q_ is any prime power congruent 1 mod 4.
